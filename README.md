Where [it](https://www.east-tec.com/eraser/) all [started](https://www.east-tec.com/eraser/reviews/).

## 1997

**Let's take a trip down memory lane:**

Welcome to [Eraser](https://www.east-tec.com/eraser/) for MS-DOS!

Eraser is still under developement.
Current version is 0.1 (pre-official release).

Eraser's main goals are super-speed and super-options.  
In its actual form Eraser is already one of the fastest file wipe utilities in the world !!! (courtesy of assembler code, of course).

Eraser97 for Windows 95 is under developement, too.  
Contact the author for more information.
